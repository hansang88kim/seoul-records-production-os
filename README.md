## What's New in v0.2.0## What's New in v0.2.0

### Manual WAV Import Pipeline
- **Tab 1 — Song Generation**: Manual WAV Import section fully rebuilt
  - Upload Candidate A / B or Selected WAV directly
  - Files saved to the **correct track folder only** (no cross-track overwrite)
  - Instant Audio QC display (duration / sample rate / channels / codec / method)
  - `project_manifest.json` updated + `project_log.jsonl` appended on every import
  - Candidate A/B selection policy applied automatically → `suno_master.wav` created

### Audio QC (`workflows/audio_qc.py`)
- ffprobe → wave module → mutagen fallback chain
- **Fake WAV detection**: MP3 data inside `.wav` extension is caught via magic-byte check
- MP3 allowed for YouTube draft preview only; distribution blocked
- `AudioQCResult` dataclass with full metadata

### Distribution Master (`workflows/create_distribution_master.py`)
- Source must be confirmed PCM WAV — fake WAV, MP3, AAC all strictly blocked
- Source already at 44.1 kHz / 16-bit / stereo → simple copy
- Off-spec WAV → FFmpeg lossless conversion
- FFmpeg absent → `manual_required`, no crash

### FFmpeg Longform Rendering (enhanced)
- `final_audio_mix.wav` generated alongside `final_video.mp4`
- Better error capture (returncode + stderr in log)
- Graceful `manual_required` when FFmpeg is missing

### Project Library
- Landing page "Open Existing Project" panel rebuilt
- Shows 5-step status icons (Song Gen / Thumbnail / Video / YouTube / Distribution)
- Sort by Newest / Oldest / Name, Resume button
- **Not a 6th tab** — 5-tab production console preserved

### Distribution Warning Fix
- QC now runs **after** metadata, rights, cover, and audio are all generated
- Eliminates false `metadata_not_ready` / `rights_statements_missing` warnings

## What This Is

Seoul Records Production OS is a local MVP application for creating AI-generated city pop album projects. It provides a full 5-tab production pipeline from song generation through music distribution, with mock providers for v0.1.x and a clear upgrade path to real integrations.

**v1.0.0-alpha: Frontend Modernization — a parallel, modern dark-theme Studio Console under frontend/, built with Next.js 15 (App Router, React 19), TypeScript (strict, @/* alias), Tailwind CSS v4, and shadcn/ui components. Hybrid strategy (Option C): the existing Streamlit app is untouched and remains the legacy/admin fallback; the Next.js console shares the same outputs/ folder and Python services via a sanitized, framework-free snapshot bridge (api/snapshot.py) that never returns tokens/cookies/keys. Routes: Dashboard + Song Lab / Thumbnail Studio / Video Renderer / YouTube Package / Production QA / UnitedMasters / Remote Control / Settings, with a responsive sidebar+topbar shell, design tokens (cyan/magenta/amber accents), and read-only status pages wired to a mock-first typed API. No backend regressions.**

**v0.9.2: Telegram Runtime Dependency Fix — declares python-telegram-bot>=21.0 in requirements.txt and pyproject.toml (plus a `remote` optional extra) so the real Telegram long-poll bot works after `pip install -r requirements.txt`. A runtime dependency check (is_telegram_package_installed / check_telegram_dependency) surfaces install status in the Production QA remote-control panel, and run_polling degrades clearly with an install hint when the package is missing — the supervisor and all other features keep working. Tokens/chat_ids remain hidden from UI and logs.**

**v0.9.1: Remote Control Plane + Supervisor Watchdog — a separate supervisor process watches the Streamlit frontend (HTTP health check on 127.0.0.1:8501), restarts it when down with a per-hour restart-loop guard, summarizes active jobs, and writes supervisor_status.json. A Telegram control bot (disabled unless TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN + TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS are set) accepts a fixed allowlist of management commands only (/status, /app, /restart_app, /jobs, /render, /youtube, /qa, /tail, /help) — there is NO shell/exec command, only whitelisted chat_ids may issue commands, and every response is redacted so no token/cookie/secret is ever exposed. Restart matches the app/main.py command line carefully and never kills the render/upload workers. Windows Task Scheduler scripts register the supervisor at logon. Read-only remote-control status panel added to Production QA. Tailscale is used for frontend access via a guide (not required).**

**v0.9.0: UnitedMasters Distribution Package Studio — a new UnitedMasters tab builds a manual-upload distribution package from the Video Renderer playlist order + streaming_cover_1x1. MP3 is included as source/draft audio (distribution_ready=false); WAV/FLAC masters (attached by path or found beside the MP3) flip tracks to Distribution Ready. No fake WAV is ever created, source MP3s are never deleted, and there is no credential storage or CAPTCHA bypass — manual upload workflow only. Produces tracklist CSV/JSON, release_metadata.json, cover (+ upload-ready), MP3 references, distribution masters when provided, and a manual upload checklist. Production QA now includes UnitedMasters readiness (MP3-only does not count as distribution-ready).**

**v0.8.4: Pilot Production QA Mode — a new Production QA tab scans the global outputs/ folder and shows an end-to-end readiness dashboard for one YouTube CityPop playlist: grouped checklists (songs / thumbnails / Canva overlays / video render / YouTube package / upload), per-group + overall readiness scores, asset warnings (optional vs blocker), a single next-recommended-action, a pilot render-sequence guide, and an exportable report (production_status.json / production_checklist.md / missing_assets.md / next_steps.md) that never contains secrets. Read-only — no changes to existing tabs.**

**v0.8.3: YouTube Real API Dependency Fix — declares the Google libraries (google-api-python-client, google-auth, google-auth-oauthlib, google-auth-httplib2) in requirements.txt and pyproject.toml, and adds a runtime dependency check so the real-upload path degrades clearly instead of silently failing: a structured check_youtube_api_dependencies() report drives the UI (Ready/Missing + "pip install -r requirements.txt"), the real-API toggle and OAuth button are disabled when libraries are missing, and the upload worker performs its own dependency guard so a real upload fails gracefully (sanitized, no secrets) instead of crashing. Mock upload, Manual Package Only default, and private-by-default are all unchanged.**

**v0.8.2: YouTube Private Upload — upload final_video.mp4 to YouTube as PRIVATE (default) via OAuth 2.0, in a background worker so the UI never blocks, then set the custom thumbnail. Manual package flow is unchanged. Tokens/client secrets/Authorization headers are redacted everywhere via a central redaction utility; token.json stays local and is excluded from exports and git. Thumbnail failure → partial_success (video stays private) with thumbnail-only retry. Tests use a mock client; no real API calls. Public upload is not implemented.**

**v0.8.1: Home Navigation UX — Video Renderer and YouTube Package are now reachable from the home screen (no open project required); both scan the global outputs/ folder, so MP3s, thumbnails, final_video.mp4, and chapters can be selected without opening a project. Tab exposure only — no changes to music generation, Thumbnail Studio, Video Renderer, or YouTube Package logic.**

**v0.8.0: YouTube Package Studio — a new top tab builds a complete YouTube upload package from final_video.mp4 + youtube_thumbnail_16x9 + chapters.txt. Generates title/description/tags/hashtags/pinned comment + a copy-ready chapters section (Korean preserved, no mojibake), validates the thumbnail (16:9, ≤2MB, compresses over-size into a separate upload-ready file without overwriting the original), writes a YouTube upload payload (privacyStatus private by default), an upload checklist, package_manifest.json, and an optional manual_upload_package.zip. Upload mode defaults to Manual Package Only; optional API upload is private-default and uses a mock client (no real API calls, OAuth tokens/Authorization headers always redacted). Music generation, Thumbnail Studio, and Video Renderer are untouched.**

**v0.7.5: Render Cancel Race Fix — a cancel requested immediately after Full Render is never lost. update_render_state refuses to overwrite a cancelling/cancelled status with running, and the worker checks for cancellation before flipping to running, before launching FFmpeg, and right after Popen — so a pre-start cancel marks the job cancelled without ever launching FFmpeg (files preserved).**

**v0.7.4: Render Cancel + Job History — Cancel Render button flips status to cancelling; the worker polls it, terminates FFmpeg, and marks the job cancelled (output/log/plan files are never deleted). render_state.json now tracks worker_pid and ffmpeg_pid separately, render_job_id carries a microsecond+uuid suffix (no same-second collisions), and a Render Job History panel lists running/completed/failed/cancelled jobs with Open Folder / View Log. Long renders run without a timeout and the progress panel recovers the active job from disk after any rerun.**

**v0.7.3: Video Render Worker + Visualizer Controls — full-length renders run in a detached background worker (Streamlit never blocks) with live FFmpeg progress (percent/time/speed/ETA via -progress pipe:1) persisted to outputs/video_renderer/jobs/. Visualizer y-position, height, width%, opacity, and glow are configurable and reflected in the real filter_complex; the Canva frame locks to the visualizer position. Previews still run inline.**

**v0.7.2: Overlay Composition — the Video Renderer now compiles overlay_plan into a real FFmpeg -filter_complex, so preview/full MP4s actually contain the audio-reactive visualizer (driven by the real audio input), Canva visualizer frame, per-track Now Playing cards (scheduled by chapter), and CTA stickers (every 5 min). Supports uploading Canva-exported PNGs (with mock fallback) and a Preview-CTA-Now option.**

**v0.7.1: MP3-first Video Renderer + Canva Asset Overlay — Video Renderer now works from MP3 alone (no WAV required, no fake WAV). Scans outputs/ for MP3s, builds 60/65/70-min playlists with repeat-until-target, prefers the clean video_playback_background, and composites Canva PNG overlays (Now Playing card, CTA sticker, visualizer frame) with an audio-reactive waveform. Includes 15s/30s/full preview renders.**

**v0.7.0: Output Asset Separation — Thumbnail Studio now exports 3 distinct deliverables: YouTube Thumbnail 16:9 (광고판), Video Playback Background 16:9 (무대, clean/no center title), and Streaming Cover 1:1 (앨범 자켓, derived from thumbnail). Includes a 1:1 crop tool and asset_manifest.json. Video Renderer prefers the clean playback background.**

**v0.6.0: Thumbnail Studio — Google Flow prompt batches, candidate gallery, and selected-image Canva branding for citypop YouTube thumbnails. Independent of music generation.**

**v0.5.0: Local WAV import pipeline — no real Suno, Canva, YouTube, or UnitedMasters APIs. Manual WAV import → FFmpeg render → Distribution package.**

**Core creative identity: Seoul Records City Pop Core**
- Japanese nostalgic city pop, sophisticated 1990s urban feeling
- Low, thick female vocal · Elegant night-city mood
- No sax lead · No drum fills · No EDM · No trot · No enka

---

## Composer Provider System

All providers implement `ComposerProvider` (defined in `providers/suno/base.py`).
The single registry lives in `providers/suno/__init__.py`.

```
COMPOSER_PROVIDER=mock              → MockSunoProvider (v0.1.x default, fast_mode)
COMPOSER_PROVIDER=manual_import     → ManualImportProvider (upload WAV directly)
COMPOSER_PROVIDER=local_unofficial  → LocalUnofficialSunoProvider (stub, v0.3)
COMPOSER_PROVIDER=playwright_web    → PlaywrightSunoWebProvider (stub, v0.3)
COMPOSER_PROVIDER=third_party       → ThirdPartySunoProvider (disabled by default)
```

**MockSunoProvider (v0.1.3):** fast_mode=True generates tiny (~500 KB) valid WAV files while simulating 3:30-4:00 metadata durations for candidate selection testing. Set fast_mode=False for full-length sine-wave audio.

**ManualImportProvider:** Upload WAV files via the Song Generation tab UI. Validates format, reads duration, and sets distribution eligibility.

**WAV-first policy:** Always prefer WAV. MP3 is preview-only. MP3 distribution is blocked by default.

---

## Candidate Selection Policy

Each Suno request returns 2 candidates. Selection rules (target: 3:30–4:00):

1. Both in range → select longer, save WAV
2. One in range → select that one
3. Both short → select longer, warn, save WAV
4. Both exceed 4:00 (strict_duration=True) → set REGENERATION_REQUIRED, do NOT save WAV
5. Mixed → select longer, warn, save WAV

---

## Running Tests

```bash
# Standard test run (recommended)
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 pytest tests/ -v -p no:cacheprovider

# Or simply
pytest tests/ -v

# Validate a packaged zip
python workflows/validate_package_zip.py dist/seoul-records-production-os-v0.1.3.zip
```

Test files:
- `test_project_creation.py` — folder structure, manifest, tracks
- `test_manifest_schema.py` — Pydantic model serialization, exclude_styles list
- `test_song_generation_mock.py` — MockSunoProvider, WAV, full workflow
- `test_candidate_selection.py` — all selection policy cases
- `test_folder_structure.py` — all step subfolders
- `test_distribution_block_mp3.py` — MP3 block, cover art copy
- `test_youtube_package.py` — thumbnail, video_path.txt, chapters
- `test_package_cleanliness.py` — source code structural checks

---

## Building a Clean Package

```bash
bash scripts/clean_package.sh 0.1.2
# → dist/seoul-records-production-os-v0.1.3.zip
```

The script cleans caches, builds the zip, and runs `validate_package_zip.py` automatically. Exits non-zero if any validation fails.

---

## Language Pack Expansion

Add new markets by creating a JSON file in `presets/language_packs/`:

```json
{
  "pack_id": "ja_jp_tokyo",
  "language": "Japanese",
  "city": "Tokyo",
  "metadata": { "generate_original": true }
}
```

No backend code changes required. Planned packs:
`ja_jp_tokyo` · `vi_vn_saigon` · `th_th_bangkok` · `zh_tw_taipei` · `yue_hk_hongkong` · `zh_cn_mainland` · `id_id_jakarta` · `ms_my_kualalumpur` · `tl_ph_manila` · `hi_in_mumbai`

> HK must use Cantonese + Traditional Chinese. Do not write Mandarin for HK.
> Always generate original lyrics in the target language. Never translate from Korean.
